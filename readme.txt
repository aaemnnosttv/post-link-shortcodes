A collection of shortcodes for building links, images, or URLs to a given post/archive of any type.

== Description ==

Aptly titled *Post Link Shortcodes*, the plugin dynamically creates shortcodes for each registered post type.  These shortcodes can be used to create an html anchor to the post, post type archive or just return the URL for either.

Each post type will have 2 shortcodes created for it where `{type}` is the name of the post type. Eg: `post` or `page`

`[{type}_url]
[{type}_link]`

If the post type was registered with `has_archive`, two more shortcodes will also be created:

`[{type}_archive_url]
[{type}_archive_link]`

**NEW in 0.4.0:**
If the post type supports `thumbnail` (featured images) two more shortcodes will also be created:
`[{type}_src]
[{type}_img]`

**NEW in 0.4.0:**
Attachment shortcodes
`[attachment_src]
[attachment_img]`
