A collection of shortcodes for building links, images, or URLs to a given post/archive of any type.

== Description ==

This plugin dynamically adds a collection of helpful shortcodes for each registered post type.  These shortcodes can be used to return URLs, or generate HTML elements like anchors and images to the related post!

Each post type will have 2 shortcodes created for it where `{type}` is the name of the post type. Eg: `post` or `page`

`[{type}_url]
[{type}_link]`

If the post type was registered with `has_archive`, two more shortcodes will also be created:

`[{type}_archive_url]
[{type}_archive_link]`

**NEW in 0.4.0:**
If the post type supports `thumbnail` (featured images) two more shortcodes will also be created:
`[{type}_src]
[{type}_img]`

**NEW in 0.4.0:**
Attachment shortcodes
`[attachment_src]
[attachment_img]`

`[post_src hello-world]
[post_img hello-world size=medium]`

**For more information and examples: [Read the Documentation](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/post-link-shortcodes/wiki)**
